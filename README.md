# Image-Detector
This project is a web-based application designed to detect whether an uploaded image is AI-generated or authentic. The system integrates a deep learning classification model with a user-friendly web interface to provide real-time predictions.
Users can upload an image through the web application, which is then processed by a trained machine learning model. The model analyzes visual patterns, textures, and structural inconsistencies commonly found in synthetic images and classifies the input as either AI-generated or real.
